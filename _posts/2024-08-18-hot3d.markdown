HOT3D is a dataset for benchmarking egocentric tracking of hands and objects in 3D captured with Meta Aria and Quest devices. The dataset includes 833 minutes of multi-view image streams, which show 19 subjects interacting with 33 diverse rigid objects and are annotated with accurate 3D poses and shapes of hands and objects
