<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>My name is Shreyas Hampali, currently a 2nd-year PhD student in Computer Vision at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision (ICG), TU Graz, Austria. I am advised by <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/vlepetit/">Prof. Vincent Lepetit</a>.
  My research interests lie in <b>hand and object pose estimation problems from RGB/RGBD images</b>. I am part of  <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institutes/icg/research/team-lepetit/">Computer Vision for Augmented Reality Lab</a> at ICG.</p>

Before starting my PhD, I worked for 6 years in semi-conductor industry, where I mostly worked on problems related to image and video.
